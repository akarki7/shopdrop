ShopDrop is your online shopping website where a user can Register themselves as Customers or Sellers and then do the transactions i.e Buy or Sell. In the database part
I have separated normal users as Customers and Sellers. Customers can look at the products and add it to their cart and buy them whereas sellers can put the products for
selling and get the money directly once the product is sold. I have also added the option for adding bank information so that the customers can directly purchase the products
and the sellers can easily receive their payments. 
In this project I have used:<br /><br />
    1) HTML<br />
    2) CSS (had used bootstrap before but I wanted to do everything myself so every styling has been done by me using hard core CSS)<br />
    3) A little bit of Javascript to make it more responsive and user interactive<br />
    4) MySQL for the backend database stuffs. (Can see the SQL codes in SQLFiles folder)<br />
    5) PHP for connecting website to database<br />
    6) AJAX and JQUERY for Auto Search Complete feature which automatically shows suggestions to users from the database when they type something in search bar<br />
    7)JS, AJAX and OpenStreetMap to show the current location of the user in the map by using the IP address of the user and finding current location.<br />
